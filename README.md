# The Generalized Linear Models course project

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are the extension of the ordinary linear regression models. GLMs enable us to use different distributions for the response with distinctive link functions. 

Here, we used two different data sets to show the broad applications of the GLMs in real-world problems, one of which is the ["Car Price Prediction"](https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction), and the other is ["Heart Failure prediction"](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). 

In our analyses, we focused on model fitting and highlighting the statistically significant variables. For a detailed description of our analyses along with results, please see the report document. In both of these studies, all analyses were performed using the R programming language.


The R and RMarkdown files related to the project is deposited in this repo.
