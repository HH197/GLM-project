### 3 GLM models and stepwise AIC selection

To begin with, let's assign each feature with a variable name.




\begin{tabular}{ |p{2.3cm}|p{3cm}|p{9cm}|p{0.7cm}|  }
 \hline
 \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Data Dictionary} \\

   Sex   &   sex of the patient   &   M: Male, F: Female   &   $x_2$   \\ 
   ChestPainType   &   chest pain type   &   TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic   &   $x_3$   \\

   FastingBS   &   fasting blood sugar   &   Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria   &   $x_6$   \\

 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 
 Since the response is having heart disease or not, it is a binomial distributed response. So it is suggested we could use a logistic regression model.
 At first, we created a logistic model of all the main effects, and the formula of the model is
$$
\log \frac{p}{1-p} = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{11} \beta_i x_i
$$
where $p$ is the probability to get the heart disease, and $\beta_i, i = 1,2, \dots, 11$ is the coefficients of the parameter, $\beta_0$ is the intercept. 
So we fitted the model, and got the estimated shown in the table below.
